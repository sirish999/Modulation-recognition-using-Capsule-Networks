# Modulation-recognition-using-Capsule-Networks

Machine Learning and Deep Learning are increasingly in
demand as tools used in data communication. In this project, I aim to
investigate the most recent deep learning framework for
wireless modulation recognition. The deep learning technique
can enhance the recognition performance with
comparatively small scale network. I have incorporated the
customized convolutional neural network(CNN) and Capsule
network to refine the achievement and decrease the complexity
of this deep learning platform with lower recognition error
rate
